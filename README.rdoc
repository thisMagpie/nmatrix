== Description

NMatrix is a fast numerical linear algebra library for Ruby, with dense and sparse matrices, written mostly in C and
C++. It is part of the SciRuby project.

NMatrix was inspired by {NArray}[http://narray.rubyforge.org], by Masahiro Tanaka.

== Installation

To install the latest stable version:

    gem install nmatrix --pre

However, you will need to install {ATLAS}[http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/] with CBLAS (C interface to
{BLAS}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms]) first. Detailed directions can be found
{here}[https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation]. The requirements for NMatrix are:

* ATLAS, preferably with CLAPACK ({see here for details}[https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation])
* a version of GCC or clang which supports C++0x or C++11
* Ruby 1.9.2+
* {packable}[http://github.com/marcandre/packable] 1.3.5 (used for I/O)

If you want to obtain the latest (development) code, you should generally do:

    git clone https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix.git
    cd nmatrix/
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake compile
    bundle exec rake repackage
    gem install pkg/nmatrix-0.1.0.rc5.gem

Detailed instructions are available for {Mac}[https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation#mac-os-x] and {Linux}[https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation#linux].
We are currently working on Mavericks (Mac OS X) installation instructions, but in general, you'll need Homebrew and should
probably use +brew install gcc48+ instead of using the install script.

== Documentation

If you have a suggestion or want to add documentation for any class or method in NMatrix, please open an issue or send a pull request with the changes.

You can find the complete API documentation {on our website}[http://sciruby.com/nmatrix/docs/].

== Examples

Create a new NMatrix from a ruby Array:

    >> require 'nmatrix'
    >> NMatrix.new([2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype: :int64)
    => [
        [0, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 5]
       ]

Create a new NMatrix using the +N+ shortcut:

    >> m = N[ [2, 3, 4], [7, 8, 9] ]
    => [
        [2, 3, 4],
        [7, 8, 9]
       ]
    >> m.inspect
    => #<NMatrix:0x007f8e121b6cf8shape:[2,3] dtype:int32 stype:dense>

The above output requires that you have a pretty-print-enabled console such as Pry; otherwise, you'll
see the output given by +inspect+.

matrix, {read the guide in our wiki}[https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/How-to-create-a-NMatrix].

== Features

The following features exist in the current version of NMatrix (0.1.0.rc1):

* Matrix and vector storage containers: dense, yale, list (more to come)
* Data types: byte (uint8), int8, int16, int32, int64, float32, float64, complex64, complex128, rational64, rational128,
  Ruby object
* Interconversion between storage and data types
* Element-wise and right-hand-scalar operations and comparisons for all matrix types
* Matrix-matrix multiplication for dense (with and without ATLAS) and yale
* Matrix-vector multiplication for dense (with and without ATLAS)
* Lots of enumerators (each, each_with_indices, each_row, each_column, each_rank, map, etc.)
* Matrix slicing by copy and reference (for dense, yale, and list)
* Native reading and writing of dense and yale matrices
  * Optional compression for dense matrices with symmetry or triangularity: symmetric, skew, hermitian, upper, lower
* Input/output:
  * Matlab .MAT v5 file input
  * MatrixMarket file input/output
  * Point Cloud Library PCD file input
* C and C++ API
* BLAS internal implementations (no library) and ATLAS (with library) access:
  * Level 1: xROT, xROTG (BLAS dtypes only), xASUM, xNRM2, IxAMAX
  * Level 2: xGEMV
  * Level 3: xGEMM, xTRSM
* LAPACK ATLAS access:
  * xGETRF, xGETRI, xGETRS, xGESV (Gaussian elimination)
  * xPOTRF, xPOTRI, xPOTRS, xPOSV (Cholesky factorization)
  * xLASWP, xSCAL, xLAUUM
* LAPACK-less internal implementations (no LAPACK needed and working on non-BLAS dtypes):
  * xGETRF
  * xLASWP, xSCAL
  * xLAUUM (no LAPACK needed, but BLAS dtypes only)
* LAPACK (non-ATLAS) access:
  * xGESVD, xGESDD (singular value decomposition)
  * xGEEV (eigenvalue decomposition of a asymmetric square matrices)
* LU decomposition
* Matrix inversions (requires LAPACK; BLAS dtypes only)
* Determinant calculation for BLAS dtypes
* Vector 2-norms
* Ruby/GSL interoperability (requires {SciRuby's fork of rb-gsl}[http://github.com/SciRuby/rb-gsl])
* slice assignments, e.g.,
    x[1..3,0..4] = some_other_matrix

=== Planned Features (Short-to-Medium Term)

We are nearing the release of NMatrix 0.1.0, our first beta.

These are features planned for NMatrix 0.2.0:

* LAPACK-free calculation of determinant, trace, and eigenvalues (characteristic polynomial)
* LAPACK-free matrix inversions
* tensor products
* improved file I/O
  * compression of yale symmetries in I/O
* optimization of non-BLAS data types on BLAS-like operations (e.g., matrix multiplication for rational numbers)
